# Project  
Cancer prediction using mRNA expression  
Project Title:  
Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq  
Project Scope:  
•	The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying and distinguishing between five distinct types of cancer through a multi-class classification approach.   
Objective/Research Question:  
•	Can machine learning algorithms demonstrate high accuracy in predicting and categorizing diverse cancer types based on a comprehensive set of 20,531 relevant features, thus offering valuable insights for early cancer diagnosis and informed treatment decisions?   
Data Source:  
•	The dataset used in this project was collected from different sites   
•	UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository   
•	Synapse.org   
Dataset Details:  
•	The dataset contains information about five distinct types of cancer: Breast Cancer (BRCA), Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC), Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD), Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD).   
•	The dataset comprises a total of 801 instances, with each instance representing a unique case or patient.   
•	It features 20,531 gene entries, each associated with specific mRNA expression values.   
•	These features have been chosen to aid in cancer diagnosis and classification.

Methodology  
Data Gathering:  
•	Research and identify suitable data sources and libraries.   
Data Manipulation:  
•	Perform essential data manipulation tasks, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and structuring, to ensure the dataset is prepared for analysis.   
Data Visualization:  
•	Utilize data visualization techniques to explore and analyze the dataset comprehensively.   
Machine Learning Algorithms:  
•	Utilize machine learning algorithms, specifically random forests, to tackle the multiclass cancer classification problem.   
Model evaluation:  
•	Employ various performance metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve, to evaluate the classifier's performance.
